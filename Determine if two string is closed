Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"
Apply Operation 1: "acb" -> "bca"

String 1 = "aabaacczp"        String 2="bbzbbaacp"
Frequency in string1 :                         Frequency in string2 :
	    a->4                                                b->4
		b->1                                                a->2
		c->2                                                z->1
		z->1                                                c->1
		p->1                                                p->1
		
see in String 1 count array ->   1, 1, 1, 2, 4 =>sorted order
and in String 2 count array ->   1, 1, 1, 2, 4 =>sorted order

Unique all char   a,b,c,z,p  in string 1 is there as well in string2 so it's a valid One just return True
